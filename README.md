# 2D Crash Simulator

## Description
This project is a 2D interactive Unity simulation that models vehicle or object crashes using realistic physics. Users can adjust parameters such as mass, impact speed, elasticity, and impact offset through UI sliders and dropdowns to observe realistic collision physics, including forces, torques, kinetic energy, and angular velocity.

The simulation demonstrates core physics concepts applicable to real-world crash analysis. Optional stretch goals include exporting simulation data for offline hypothesis testing and analysis.
